Instructions not yet done, but in short:

1. npm install (in this folder)
2. node thecallscript.js (follow instructions)
3. Build your app in App folder
4. Tricky part now, in order to run it through Backbone, you need to run main.js from /foreground folder, with -appRoot (path to your app) and mode (barebone / raw). Example:

node main.js sessionID=your-xsession appRoot=../App mode=barebone
