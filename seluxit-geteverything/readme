Instructions not yet done, but in short:

0. open terminal here
1. npm install (in this folder)
2. node thecallscript.js (follow instructions)
3. Build your app in App folder or edit your downloaded app.
4. Tricky part now, in order to run it through rest-api, you need to run main.js from /foreground folder, with -appRoot (path to your app) and mode (barebone / raw). 

Example:
node main.js sessionID=your-xsession appRoot=../App mode=barebone
