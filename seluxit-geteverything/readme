Instructions are simple, in short:
0. open terminal here in the folder
1. npm install (in this folder)
2. node thecallscript.js (and follow instructions)


Functionalities:
- Login + save to config file.
- Create new app, both foreground / background supported.
- Download any version of any map you have on your account.
- Delete from your account either a version or a whole app.
- Update any app. Verifies for existing files and updates them, and then uploads the new ones.
- Verifying for installations and creating them.
- Run your background code. This is still in beta stage, has some misbehaviour.

Problem with run
This is still in progress. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. 'nrc.run' for some reason doesn't always call the method at stdout. Might need replacement of this. function name: runApp(). Everything works before that (creating installation or getting existing one, etc), but it just won't run it as it should. 

Other smaller problems
- Folder in folder not supported. If developing an app, you should have all files in the backgorund / foreground folders. Creating subfolders might lead to misbehaviour.
- Downloading multiple times same app will confuse you when choosing what to run. You can have endless times each version on your computer, and if you go to Run screen, it will display all that endless apps, which most probably will have the same name and you might get confused. So be sure to keep your folders clean and delete unused apps.
